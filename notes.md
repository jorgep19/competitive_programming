Chapter 1:

- because dev enviroments can be different from what is created by your IDE.
  It may be a good idea to practice coding with just a text editor and a compiler! :\

Tips:

1) Type fast
2) Identify problem types
  * A, B, or C: Done and can redo, seen can't do fast, not seen.
  * Category or approach type: 
    Ad Hoc, Greed, Divide and Conquer, Search, DP, Graph, 
    Math, String Processing, Comp Geometry, Harder
3) Do algorithm Analysis 
  * memory and time considering input boundaries.
  * keep in mind that computer do around 100 million operations per second.
4) Master Programming Languages
  * Keep coding and actually learn the libraries of your language.
5) Master the art of testing code
  * use input and output files. 
  * Don't compare by hand use diff or some automated method for compering 
    you and the expected output.
6) Practice
  * 
7) 

TODO!
Lear how to properlly parse with Java:
1) Sample input 1: N on first line and then pair of integers:

```
3
1 2
5 7
6 3
```
2) int pairs going until 0 0

3) int pairs going to EOD

```
1 2 
5 7
6 3
```

Exercises: 

1.2.2:

1) a
2) b but idk technique
3) a
4) a
5) c 
6) a
7) b. !n for 10,000 will e to slow or even cause stack overflows.
8) b
9) b

1.2.3:

1) 

1.2.4:

1) c
2) b
3) b
4) b
5) try directly with the compiler.
6) do that problem!
7) consider problem Y a bit closer for your next problem
8) look at other problems or challenge the judge ouput.
9) c or b

1.3.1: Read full line and then parse each number in the line.
